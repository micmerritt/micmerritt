## About

I am interested in how people think, learn, and make decisions inside complex technical systems, especially when those systems are shaped by artificial intelligence or security constraints.

My work spans **AI security, cybersecurity, education, and human cognition**, and it has always been driven by the gap between how systems are designed in theory and how they are experienced in practice. I pay close attention to how tools, policies, and organizational incentives shape judgment, often in subtle ways that prioritize speed, output, or compliance while obscuring understanding and adaptability.

In recent years, much of my scholarly work has focused on **AI literacy and human–AI interaction**. I examine why the same AI systems can support insight and learning for some individuals while creating confusion or disengagement for others. Questions of metacognition, cognitive modes of engagement, and neurodiversity run through this work, not as abstract concerns, but as practical explanations for uneven outcomes in education and professional settings. I share this research through journals, conference talks, and peer-reviewed venues.

Alongside my academic work, I advise organizations on **AI security, adversarial risk, and cybersecurity strategy** drawing on my background in offensive security, security engineering, and enterprise risk. 

Whether I am researching, teaching, or consulting, the underlying question remains the same: **how do we design systems that support sound thinking under pressure**, rather than simply accelerating output or automation?
